# Your First Prompt Makes or Breaks Everything in Bolt.new

If you've used bolt.new, you know the frustration. You type a prompt, hit enter, and watch the AI build something that's... *close*, but not quite right. 

Maybe it missed key features. Maybe the design doesn't match what you had in mind. Maybe it built the wrong thing entirely.  

So you try again. And again. Each iteration burns through time, credits, and momentum.

**Here's the reality: in vibe-coding, your first prompt is everything.**

A vague prompt gets you a vague project. A poorly structured prompt leads to endless back-and-forth. And when you're staring at that empty text box, it's hard to know where to start. What details matter? What should you include? How do you communicate your vision in a way that actually works?

This is where most people get stuck. And it's not your fault.

Translating an idea in your head into a structured, comprehensive prompt that an AI can execute isn't intuitive. Professional prompt engineers spend hours learning frameworks, studying what works, and crafting the perfect inputs. But you just want to build your app, landing page, or extension without needing a PhD in prompt engineering.

## How It Works

The extension walks you through a carefully designed process that captures your project vision systematically:

**Understanding Your Build**  
The questionnaire adapts based on what you're creating—whether it's a Chrome extension, micro-SaaS app, mobile app, landing page, or custom project. Each question is tailored to extract the specific details that matter for your type of build.

**Smart, Context-Aware Questions**  
No generic prompts. The extension asks targeted questions that reveal the critical details bolt.new needs: who you're building for, what problems you're solving, and how your solution should work. The questions adapt intelligently based on your previous answers.

**Professional Prompt Generation**  
Once you've answered the questions, the extension uses **Claude Haiku 4.5** to generate a comprehensive, structured prompt following proven frameworks optimized for AI-driven development. Everything is focused on **WHAT** to build, ensuring comprehensive coverage without over-specifying implementation details.

You can review, edit, and refine the generated prompt before copying it directly into bolt.new.
